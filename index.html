	<h2>About the Program</h2>
	
	</div>
    
	<p>The Clarke County Mentor Program is an organization that employs volunteers, who are at least 18, to be mentors.
	These mentors will be assigned to a child at a local school in the county. The main focus of the program is to match
	up a friend who provides support, encouragement, and guidance with a young person. This program proves to be a rewarding
	experience not only for the child, but for the mentor as well. Check out the 
	<a href="http://clarkecountymentorprogram.org/">Clarke County Mentor Program Website</a> for more information!</p>
	
	<h2>My Experience with the Program</h2>

	<p>I decided to become a mentor mainly to try to get involved in the community. I wanted to use this opportunity as just another volunteer
	work that I could add to my resume. However, I soon realized that this experience would be one that I cherish forever. This program
	gave me the potential to change a young person's life. Having a mentee forces me to stop thinking about myself on a consistent basis.
	I put my energy into helping someone reach their future goals and overcome their fears and they have helped me to see that my problems 
	were not insurmountable. Becoming a mentor has lead to a series of events and opportunities that I would never had before.<br>Getting involved
	has forced me to learn, evolve, and overall, become a better person.</p>
